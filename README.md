AliExpress Product Scraper

This Python script uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape product data from the AliExpress website. It allows you to extract product names, prices, ratings, reviews, and other information from the product pages on AliExpress and export it to a CSV file.

Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:


pip install beautifulsoup4 requests

Usage

To use the script, simply run the aliexpress_scraper.py file from the command line:

python aliexpress_scraper.py

The script will prompt you to enter the search query for the products you want to scrape. It will then scrape data from the product pages on AliExpress, and save the data to a CSV file named aliexpress_products.csv in the same directory as the script.
